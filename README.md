# UFOs

Inroduction:
Java Script was developed in 1995 and is widely used today and has been updated with ES6 update.
In this project I will be utilizing, Java, HTML and Bootstrap.
The purpose of this project is to help Dana create an interactive webpage that allows
readers to parse data about UFO sightings. I will build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. 
in the project I will create filters to make this table fully dynamic, the table will be put into an HTML file for easy viewing.

Analysis:

Building this table using complexed for loops using similar logic as Python helped. Code alignment in code blocks is important in keeping 
the lines of code clean and easier to read. It also makes it easier to spot syntax errors. While working in Java the forEach loops only work with arrays.
However the benefit is that they can be combined with an arrow function making your code easier to read and more concise.


Conclusion:
I have created an interactive, functional table that can be filtered by date to research UFO sightings.
